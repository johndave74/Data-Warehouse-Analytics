# 🧮 Data Warehouse Analytics – SQL Project

This project focuses on running advanced SQL analytics on a simulated data warehouse environment. It provides insight into sales performance, warehouse efficiency, part category trends, and revenue dynamics using real-world business questions.

## 📊 Project Objectives

The goal is to demonstrate how SQL can be used to solve core data warehouse analytics problems using complex, business-oriented queries. This includes:

- Monthly revenue analysis across warehouse locations
- Identifying high-performing products and part categories
- Trend analysis of net revenue over time
- Performance comparisons between different warehouses

## 🧱 Sample Schema

The dataset used includes the following fields:

- `product_id` (VARCHAR)
- `part_category` (VARCHAR)
- `warehouse_location` (VARCHAR)
- `sales_date` (DATE)
- `revenue` (NUMERIC)
- `units_sold` (INT)

## 🛠️ SQL Concepts Demonstrated

- **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**
- **Window Functions**: `RANK()`, `LAG()`, `DENSE_RANK()`
- **Aggregation**: `SUM()`, `ROUND()`
- **Date Handling**: `DATE_TRUNC()`, `INTERVAL`
- **Subqueries and Derived Tables**
- **Performance Rankings and Revenue Shares**

## ✅ How to Use

1. Import the sample dataset into your SQL database (PostgreSQL recommended).
2. Run the scripts in `/scripts/` to execute the analytics queries.
3. Modify queries as needed for your dataset or SQL dialect.

## 📈 Key Business Insights

- How sales and revenue change month-to-month across warehouses
- Which products and categories drive the most revenue
- Distribution of revenue contribution by warehouse
- Identifying performance gaps and growth opportunities
